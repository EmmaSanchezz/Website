        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <h2>What is Bookshelves?</h2>
        <p>Bookshelves is similar to your local library, except it contains only books from my personal library, most of which are Manga with the exception of a few fiction novels.</p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>In Spring of 2024, Emma Sanchez was attending the University of South Carolina and was taking ITEC362. She was told to create a website of her own. From there, she played back and forth with the idea of making a website similar to GoodReads where you can connect with friends to keep track of books you read and encourage others to read. She disliked that idea and turned to the idea of making her website similar to Barnes and Noble, but on a smaller scale. I created this website to provide the community of Columbia with convenience and reliability when looking to checkout books from my personal library.</p>
